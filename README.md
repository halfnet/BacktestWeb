# BacktestWeb
Backtest written in R

TODOs:
1) better error handling
    1a) currently processdata and generatemetrics have a lot of common codes, need to modulize them as much as possible: such as create a function for metric calc
2) additional automation on data check
3) Setup to include additional scores such as : ESG or liquidity
